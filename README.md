# Advent of code 2021 [![Python package](https://github.com/swd1tn002/advent-of-code-2021/actions/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/swd1tn002/advent-of-code-2021/actions/workflows/python-package.yml)

Personal attempts at solving https://adventofcode.com/ with Python and learning Python development.

## Things exercised during the days

* Day 1 and day 2

    * Pytest
    * GitHub actions
    * `map` function

* Day 3

    * type hinting
    * `from typing import List`
    * `zip` function

    * parsing binary numbers to decimals
    * pytest `@fixture`

* Day 4

    * `zip` function
    * transposing a matrix with `zip` function
    * flatmap with Python generators

* Day 5

    * named tuples

* Day 6

    * using `pop` to simulate a queue with a list

* Day 7

    * speeding up recurring calls to function by memoizing the results with `@cache` decorator
