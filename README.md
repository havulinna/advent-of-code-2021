# Advent of code 2021 [![Python package](https://github.com/swd1tn002/advent-of-code-2021/actions/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/swd1tn002/advent-of-code-2021/actions/workflows/python-package.yml)

Personal attempts at solving https://adventofcode.com/ with Python and learning Python development.

## Things exercised during the days

* Days [1](01_sonar_sweep/) and [2](02_dive)

    * Pytest
    * GitHub actions
    * `map` function

* [Day 3](03_binary_diagnostic/)

    * type hinting
    * `from typing import List`
    * `zip` function
    * bitwise xor `^`
    * parsing binary numbers to decimals
    * pytest `@fixture`

* [Day 4](04_giant_squid/)

    * `zip` function
    * transposing a matrix with `zip` function
    * flatmap with Python generators

* [Day 5](05_hydrothermal_venture/)

    * named tuples

* [Day 6](06_lanternfish/)

    * using `pop` to simulate a queue with a list

* [Day 7](07_the_treachery_of_whales/)

    * speeding up recurring calls to function by memoizing the results with `@cache` decorator

* [Day 8](08_seven_segment_search/)

    * all sorts of set operations
    * iter and next

* [Day 9](09_smoke_basin/)

    * enumerate

* Days [10](10_syntax_scoring/) and [11](11_dumbo_octopus/)

    * regular expressions
    * using a dict with coordinates to represent two dimensional maps

* [Day 12](12_passage_pathing/)

    * Classes and objects
    * `__str__` and `__repr__`

* [Day 13](13_transparent_origami/)

    * Thinking in terms of sets of coordinates and not two dimensional structures

* [Day 14](14_extended_polymerization/)

    * First puzzle that I could not solve alone. Found a hint for part 2 from Koodiklinikka.
    * Using Counter to streamline counting character values

* [Day 15](15_chiton/)

    * Using Dijkstra's Algorithm to find minimum travel cost between two points

* [Day 16](16_packet_decoder/)

    * Object oriented programming
    * Superclasses and subclasses
    * Overriding `__len__` and `__eq__`
    * Creating generator functions with `yield` keyword

* [Day 17](17_trick_shot)

    * Object oriented programming

* [Day 18](18_snailfish)

    * This was quite tricky
    * Using reduce to add all snail numbers together

* [Day 19](19_beacon_scanner/)

    * This was again very difficult to solve...
    * Yielding lambdas

* [Day 20](20_trench_map/)

    * Working with infinite size images

* [Day 21](21_dirac_dice/)

    * Second puzzle where I could not solve part 2 alone. Found a hint 2 from Koodiklinikka.

* [Day 22](22_reactor_reboot/)

    * Got a slow but working solution together after all.
    * Splitting a collection overlapping 3D cubes into non-overlapping ones until no cubes overlap.

* [Day 23](23_amphipod/)

    * Applying the shortest path logic to find the most efficient moves to solve a puzzle.

* [Day 24](24_arithmetic_logic_unit/)

    * Iterative and recursive calls to a list of functions to keep and cache intermediate results.
    * Interpreting another languate into Python.
